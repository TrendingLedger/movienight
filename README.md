The following is to help those who might be following tutorials and to help get a sense of timing and planning. It's also for personal learning and educational purposes. If you happen to stumble on here, welcome.

## **Overall Game Plan**
This project is based on a JavaScript Mastery YouTube tutorial. I'm documenting the process to understand the time investment needed for both personal learning and student guidance.

The tutorial covers:
- Building a movie search application using React
- Integration with themoviedb API
- Implementation of AppWrite
- Modern React development practices

Original tutorial length: ~2 hours
Expected completion time: 6-10 hours (3x-5x original length)

## **Actual Reality**
_Timeline tracking will be updated as the project progresses..._

### Tech Stack:
- React
- Vite
- themoviedb API
- AppWrite
