The following is to help those who might be following tutorials and to help get a sense of timing and planning. It's also for personal learning and educational purposes. If you happen to stumble on here, welcome.

## **Overall Game Plan**
This project is based on a JavaScript Mastery YouTube tutorial. I'm documenting the process to understand the time investment needed for both personal learning and student guidance.

The tutorial covers:
- Building a movie search application using React
- Integration with themoviedb API
- Implementation of AppWrite
- Modern React development practices

Original tutorial length: ~2 hours
Expected completion time: 6-10 hours (3x-5x original length)

## **Actual Reality**
_Timeline tracking will be updated as the project progresses..._

-Tried to signed up to the movie db and haven't got the key or it would take lots more info or steps. so decided to do mock data generated by AI Claude. 

-Simulate spinner of loading by delaying 

-3 to 4 hours in and half way through the 2 hour YouTube tutorial

-creating the movie card but since no API gonna generate some random images from unsplash. also listening to classical music and just moving along. that generating took about 30 minutes? maybe an hour just looking admiring all the unsplash pictures
